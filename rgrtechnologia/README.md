# CHALLENGE RGRTECHNOLOGIA

Create a command-line application that, given a list of website URLs as input, visits them
and finds, extracts and outputs the websitesâ€™ logo image URLs and all phone numbers (e.g.
mobile phones, land lines, fax numbers) present on the websites.

### RUN THE PROJECT
* clone the project.

#### - NO IMAGE DOCKER
CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IF YOU WANT 
```
cat website.txt | python3 -m pagescrap
```


#### - WITH IMAGE DOCKER
first let's create a volume for sharing the generated content
* important that the volume name is local to avoid errors
```
docker volumes create local
``` 

ready, now with the volume created let's start our docker image
```
docker build -t pagescrap .
```

now we can finally run our program and see the magic happening.
```
cat website.txt | docker run -i pagescrap:latest
```

##### ENDING

your results will be in a file called results.json and in your terminal
